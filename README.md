# [OptViz](https://optviz.up.railway.app/)

This web-based tool provides an interactive visualization of optimization algorithms, including both gradient-based and meta-heuristic methods. Key features include:

- 3D and Contour Plots: Interactive visualizations to illustrate optimization paths dynamically.
- Automatic Differentiation: Custom-built from scratch to compute gradients of arbitrary functions.
- Expression Parsing & Visualization: Uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to parse mathematical expressions and GraphViz to render backward DAGs and ASTs.
- User-Friendly Interface: Supports dynamic parameter tuning, step-by-step animation controls, and flexible plot adjustments with Plotly.js.
